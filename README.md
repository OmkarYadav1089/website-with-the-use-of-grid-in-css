# website-with-the-use-of-grid-in-css
Created  a website with the help of HTML CSS and some good properties of CSS. This project contains all the basic properties of CSS and HTML that is required for the beginner to get the hands on command on all over the HTML and CSS. 


Use merely all the properties of the HTML and CSS 
and also quite user friemdly .
created the whole design on the concept of display grid.

"display : grid "
If u dont know about this let me help u understand this property its quite like the "display: flex" but in 2 diimension.
As in display flex we give the change of dimension in x as well as y axis on different line while in this we just give the display" grid and our whole work of multiple changes happen in just a single line.

"@mediaframes(max-width:600px)"

This is used to make the site responsive and also i used it in my project (aka website page) that i created so that anyone who commit it will get good grasp about what i done.

Now what's the use of it :

1. It make u understand the beauty of the css.
2. It help u grab the more concepts in less time.
3. it also give the good styling to ur whole page in a single line.

At last i will tell u the secret of the whole wesite creation :
1. Make it whole on a single page (mean user doesnt have to scroll ur site to see the whole content).
2. Another make ur all website compatible in the phone too.(mean make it responsive for all devices(If  u cant make for all just make it for phone .))
